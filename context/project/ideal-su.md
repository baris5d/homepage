title: 'Ideal Su'
description: <p>We have queried the question "How should be the ideal water". Our motto was "Your ideal water". During the development, we have specified the target audience in terms of their social status. These statues were defined as B1, B2, C1, C2 which correspond to interest and interact rates of digital sources. After that, we follow a story-based model to establish emotional ties with customers and the brand. The "ideal" story starts with rain on the top of Toros mountain, it flows down to the ground. It is filtered after 15 years-long journey. It gains its minerals and pH to achieves the "ideal" that is aimed by nature. You can see the story starts with only a drop in an animated way.</p>
